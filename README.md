tips to working with git and github

Name: Taran Panduranga

In the rare occasion that I am at a party, I tell people that I work with making unreadable data into something useful.

The three main activities I have been doing when studying is descrete math, statistics, and Calculus.

I have three effective ways for me to study. First I always try to learn from different sources to gain serveral perspecitves of one topic. Secondly, I make sure that the topic I am studying is fully understood instead of skimming over the subject. Lastly, when I study, I have a set time when I am studying, with short breaks in the middle. This helps with focus and procrastination.

Data Analysis

In the past month, the three activities I've been working on are
1.Analyzing the data collected over time in R studio for my class STAT 472
2.perform hypothesis testing and point estimation
3.Constructing plots (Boxplots,Density Plot, Contour plot) using ggplot in R

Tools and strategies for organising my work
1.Box to organize my files by class and type.I can create folders and subfolders, so I can keep related files together and easily find what I need.
2.I create separate projects for each class in RStudio to avoid confusion and organise my work.
3.To ensure my files are always up-to-date,I save them in your Box folder. This will allow Box to automatically sync changes across all devices.

Edit: I think that this is a good way to describe data science, and I this your study strategies are effective.
