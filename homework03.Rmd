# There were two successful pull requests from both me and my
# partner. I requested changes to Tanishq-6/practice1-Tanishq-6,
# and accepeted two pull requests from Tanishq-6/practice1-Tanishq-6.

# c. The first tip is when starting, practice forking, pulling, and pushing with a partner so that you   #can see there screen as changes are being made. Secondly, it would be prudent to take a moment to #understand how your work is connected in the overall structure of git. The third tip is to keep #practicing to the point that there is a firm understanding of forking, pushing, and pulling from a #repository.
